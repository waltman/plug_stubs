Utility to create dated stubs for monthly Philadelphia Linux User Group meetings

For historical reasons the [Upcoming Meetings](http://www.phillylinux.org/meetings.html) page for the [Philadelphia Linux Users Group](http://www.phillylinux.org/) uses a hardwired HTML table. There are 3 meetings most months, which are held on the first Wednesday, second Tuesday, and third Monday of the month. They use the following template:

```
<tr class="central">
  <td><a name="c20191002" />PLUG Central</td>
  <td class="date">10/2/2019</td>
  <td class="tbd">To be determined</td>
  <td class="tbd">To be determined</td>
  <td><a href="locations/usp.html">USP</a></td>
</tr>

<tr class="north">
  <td><a name="n20191008" />PLUG North</td>
  <td class="date">10/8/2019</td>
  <td class="tbd">To be determined</td>
  <td class="tbd">To be determined</td>
  <td><a href="locations/coredial.html">Coredial, Blue Bell</a></td>
</tr>

<tr class="west">
  <td><a name="w20191021" />PLUG West</td>
  <td class="date">10/21/2019</td>
  <td class="tbd">To be determined</td>
  <td class="tbd">To be determined</td>
  <td><a href="locations/ats.html">ATS</a></td>
</tr>
```

It gets tedious looking up the dates each month, so `plug_stubs` does the date math and generates the stubs for a new month. The syntax is

```
plug_stubs YYYY MM
```

For example, the stubs above can be generated by running

```
plug_stubs 2019 10
```
